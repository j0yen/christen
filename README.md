The wintermute agent-namespace substrate is built and booted but inert:

## Overview

The wintermute agent-namespace substrate is built and booted but inert:
every session is born in the *initial* namespace with session id `0…0`
because no launch path routes through `agentns-claude`. Before anything can
fix that, there must be a typed, testable model of **where sessions are
born** (`LaunchSite`), **whether each is wrapped** (`WrapState`), and **what
edit would route it through the wrapper** (`RouteAction`). **christen-plan**
creates the `christen` workspace and that foundation: the shared types, a
`LaunchSiteSource` trait that abstracts discovery, a `FakeSource` for tests,
and a **pure** `plan(sites, kernel, wrapper_installed)` that emits a
print-only `RoutePlan`. `christen plan` shows it at a glance. The rest of
the vision extends this crate.


## Acceptance


1. `cargo build` and `cargo test` succeed offline; a test asserts `plan`
   makes **zero** source calls (it operates only on the passed `&[RawSite]`
   + injected `KernelInfo` + `wrapper_installed`).
2. `LaunchSite`, `SiteKind`, `WrapState`, `RouteAction`, `RoutePlan` are
   public and `serde`-(de)serializable; a round-trip test covers each.
3. `ChristenConfig::load` parses `config/christen.example.toml`; a fixture
   yields the expected `default_budget` + `systemd_dir` + one
   `intent_overrides` entry, and an absent file yields documented defaults.
4. `plan` classifies correctly against `FakeSource` fixtures: a systemd site
   whose exec line lacks `agentns-claude` on a `-wintermute` kernel with the
   wrapper installed → `Unwrapped` + `Wire` (the `to` line contains
   `agentns-claude --intent <derived> --budget <default> --`); a site whose
   exec line already contains `agentns-claude` → `Wrapped` + `AlreadyWrapped`;
   a shell-rc site → `Advise`; any site on a kernel with `agent_ns:false` or
   `wrapper_installed:false` → `Skip` with the documented reason.
5. `intent_for` derives `/build`/`/dream`/`/self-review`/`interactive` for
   the four canonical site ids, and `intent_overrides` from config wins over
   the derivation; both covered by tests.
6. `christen plan --format json` emits one entry per site plus the
   `RoutePlan` tallies (`to_wire`/`advised`/`already`/`skipped`); schema
   matches the documented `RoutePlan`.
7. `christen plan` exits non-zero when ≥1 site is `Unwrapped` (wrapper
   installed, `-wintermute` kernel), zero otherwise; two integration cases
   driving `FakeSource`. `christen plan | head -1` does not panic (SIGPIPE
   reset verified by a test that closes the read end early).
8. README documents the config format, the type surface, the `intent_for`
   derivation table, and the `LaunchSiteSource` trait so christen-detect /
   christen-route / christen-cap / christen-ledger have a contract to extend.

## christen probe — namespace state classifier

`christen probe` reads the `/proc` agent-namespace surface for the current
process (or a target PID) and classifies it into one of four states with
correct, actionable prose.

### The four states

| State | Meaning | `ok` | Docket op |
|-------|---------|------|-----------|
| `absent` | `/proc/$pid/ns/agent` symlink missing | `true` on stock kernel, `false` on `-wintermute` | `Report` (wintermute only) |
| `init` | Session id is all-zeros or ns inode is the init inode | `true` (not a fault) | `Report` actionable (wintermute + wrapper) or `None` |
| `live` | Non-zero session id — session is in its own namespace | `true` | `Resolve agentns-session-zeros` |
| `malformed` | Surface present but unparseable | `false` | `Report` |

### Init-inode detection

On Linux the agent-namespace init inode is `4026531996`. A process born in
the initial namespace (before any launch site is routed through `agentns-claude`)
will have `/proc/self/ns/agent -> agent:[4026531996]` and a session id of all
zeros. This is **not** a fault — it means the wrapper is installed but exec
lines have not been rewritten yet. The fix is `christen route`.

### Anti-regression invariant

The string `"registration failed"` **never** appears in any `prose` returned
by `christen probe`. This invariant is asserted by a dedicated test
(`probe_ac3_antiregression`) that iterates every `NsState` variant.

### `--emit` docket contract

When `--emit` is passed, `christen probe` shells `docket` with the mapped op:

- `live` → `docket resolve agentns-session-zeros`
- `init` (UnwrappedExpected, -wintermute) → `docket report --severity warn --title "agentns init NS — launches not routed through agentns-claude; run christen route" ...`
- `absent` (-wintermute) → `docket report --severity warn ...`
- any stock-kernel state → no docket op

A missing `docket` binary is non-fatal: the probe prints its classification
and exits on state, not on the docket failure.

### Usage

```sh
# Classify current process (human-readable text)
christen probe

# Classify current process and apply docket edge-trigger
christen probe --emit

# Classify a specific PID as JSON
christen probe --pid 1234 --format json

# JSON schema includes: state, ok, prose, session_hex?, intent?, docket_op
```

## christen cap — capability grant advisor

`christen cap` detects whether `agentns-claude` / `agent-wrap` carry the
`cap_sys_admin+ep` file capability required for `unshare(CLONE_NEWAGENT)` to
succeed.  It **prints** the exact `sudo setcap` line the user must run and
explains the precise scope of the grant.  It **never** runs `setcap`
automatically — the grant is the user's choice.

### Why the capability is required

`agent-wrap.c` and `agentns-claude` both document: "Needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
The intended deployment is file caps: `sudo setcap cap_sys_admin+ep
/home/jsy/.local/bin/agent-wrap`."  Without this capability,
`unshare(CLONE_NEWAGENT)` fails with `EPERM` and the launcher silently falls
back to an unwrapped exec — every session is still born with
`agent_session = 0…0` and the `agentns-session-zeros` docket item never
clears.  `christen route`'s wiring (the systemd drop-ins) is inert until
this cap is granted: the drop-ins correctly route through `agentns-claude`,
but `agentns-claude` itself cannot create the namespace without the cap.

### Scope mitigation — why a file capability is safe

`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is broad (mounts, namespaces, many privileged kernel calls).
The scoped mitigation applied here:

- **File-scoped**: only the one audited binary receives the capability — not
  the system, not your shell, not any other process.
- **Not setuid-root**: the binary runs as your user; the capability is only
  available to that specific binary on exec.
- **+ep (Effective + Permitted)**: the kernel sets the capability in the
  process's effective set on exec, allowing the `unshare` call to succeed
  without any other privilege escalation.
- **Exec boundary reset**: `agent-wrap` calls `exec(2)` into `agentns-claude`
  which calls `exec(2)` into `claude` — file capability rules reset at each
  exec, so `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` does not propagate into the final `claude` process.

### Print-only grant flow

```sh
# Print scope explainer + per-binary state + the setcap command to run
christen cap

# JSON output (machine-readable)
christen cap --format json

# After granting — verify the cap worked without re-running setcap
christen cap --verify
```

`christen cap` never executes `setcap`.  The output includes a fixed scope
explainer block (see `SCOPE_EXPLAINER` in `src/cap.rs`) that must appear
before any `setcap` line — asserted by tests.

### Post-grant verification (`--verify`)

`christen cap --verify` spawns `agentns-claude` (or `agent-wrap`) under `sbx`
and reads the child's `/proc/$pid/agent_session`:

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Live { session_id }` | Nonzero session id — cap granted and unshare succeeded |
| `EPERM-fallback` | Session id is all-zeros — cap not yet granted (or unshare fell back) |
| `Absent` | Kernel does not have `CONFIG_AGENT_NS=y` |
| `Error { detail }` | Launcher not found or spawn failed |

This is an I/O-performing function; all other cap logic (`cap_plan`) is pure.
AC6 (verify on `-wintermute` kernel) is marked **deferred** — it requires the
live kernel + real launcher + `sbx`, none of which are available in CI.

### Open decision — setuid-helper alternative

An alternative narrower-privilege approach exists: a minimal **setuid-root
helper** binary that calls `unshare(CLONE_NEWAGENT)` and immediately drops
all capabilities before exec-ing into the actual launcher.

| | File cap on launcher | Setuid helper |
|---|---|---|
| **Privilege scope** | `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` on one audited binary | Setuid-root on a tiny helper; drops caps before exec |
| **Attack surface** | Larger binary, but no setuid bit | Smaller binary, but setuid-root |
| **Auditability** | Straightforward — `getcap` shows the grant | Requires auditing the drop sequence |
| **Complexity** | One `sudo setcap` line | Extra helper binary to build + install |
| **Deployment** | Already documented in `agent-wrap.c` | Not yet implemented |

**Current recommendation**: use the file capability on `agent-wrap` /
`agentns-claude` as documented in the source.  The setuid-helper path is
recorded here as an open decision; no code path auto-installs either.

## christen ledger — per-session identity and footprint recorder

`christen ledger` records each session's true identity and syscall footprint.
At session birth it writes a `LedgerEntry`; at session end it patches it with
final counters. Entries persist under `~/.claude/christen/ledger/<session_id>.json`.

### Entry schema

```json
{
  "session_id": "deadbeefcafe0001",
  "intent":     "build",
  "budget":     "normal",
  "opened_at":  1700000000,
  "closed_at":  1700000120,
  "start": { "total_syscalls": 0, "openat_count": 0, "write_bytes": 0,
              "connect_count": 0, "unlink_count": 0, "fork_count": 0,
              "elapsed_ns": 0 },
  "end":   { "total_syscalls": 500, "openat_count": 40, "write_bytes": 65536,
              "connect_count": 3, "unlink_count": 0, "fork_count": 1,
              "elapsed_ns": 120000000000 },
  "kernel": "6.9.0-wintermute"
}
```

`closed_at` and `end` are omitted when the session is still open. A session
that never received a `close` call (killed by SIGKILL / cgroup teardown) will
have no `closed_at` — this is a signal, not a bug.

### Open-only entries as SIGKILL signals

`christen ledger list --open-only` shows sessions that opened but never
closed. Headless build ticks are killed by cgroup teardown before graceful
hooks run, so every headless tick appears here. Persistent open entries point
to SIGKILL casualties rather than normal exits.

### Relationship to agentns-doctor receipt

`agentns-doctor receipt` already snapshots agent-namespace counters to a JSON
ledger (session receipt). `christen ledger` is the *wiring*: it calls the
snapshot at the right moments (SessionStart / SessionEnd hooks), keys entries
by the true session id, and accumulates them under one directory for
cross-session queries.

### Session id attribution

The ledger key is the same id that agorabus, memlog, and provfs attribute
syscalls to. When `christen-route` + `christen-cap` are in place, this id is
non-zero and all three subsystems converge on the same session. Without
routing the id is `0…0` and `christen ledger open` exits with an error
(inert — it does not write a zero-keyed entry).

### Usage

```sh
# Open a ledger entry for the current session (call from SessionStart hook)
christen ledger open

# Close the ledger entry for the current session (call from SessionEnd hook)
christen ledger close

# List all sessions (table)
christen ledger list

# List only sessions that never closed (SIGKILL casualties)
christen ledger list --open-only

# List as JSON (one object per session + EntrySummary fields)
christen ledger list --format json

# Show a full entry + delta for a given session id
christen ledger show deadbeefcafe0001

# Print settings.json hook entries (never writes anything)
christen ledger install
```

### Hook installer (print-only)

`christen ledger install` prints the `settings.json` `SessionStart` and
`SessionEnd` hook entries and a note that they are inert until `christen-route`
and `christen-cap` make the session id real. It never writes to `~/.claude`
or shells any command.
